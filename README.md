# Uberdrive Python EDA Project

## Overview
This Python EDA project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Uber trip records. The dataset includes information such as start and end dates, trip categories, start and stop locations, miles traveled, and trip purposes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. **START_DATE**: The date and time when the trip started.
2. **END_DATE**: The date and time when the trip ended.
3. **CATEGORY**: The category of the trip, whether it was for business or personal purposes.
4. **START**: The starting location of the trip.
5. **STOP**: The destination of the trip.
6. **MILES**: The distance traveled in miles during the trip.
7. **PURPOSE**: The purpose of the trip, which could include various reasons such as meetings, meals/entertainment, errands, customer visits, etc. Some entries may have missing values for this column.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this EDA project are as follows:
- Perform data cleaning to handle missing values.
- Explore the distribution and trends of Uber trips based on various factors such as  trip duration, distance traveled, and trip purposes.
- Identify any patterns or correlations between different variables in the dataset.
- Visualize the findings using appropriate graphs and charts to gain insights into Uber trip patterns and behaviors.
- Draw conclusions and provide recommendations based on the analysis results.

## Tools Used
- Python programming language
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis and visualization
